# 🧾 Inventory Management System (Flask + MySQL)

**Live Demo:** [https://marwin18.pythonanywhere.com/](https://marwin18.pythonanywhere.com/)

## 📖 About the Project

This is a simple **Inventory Management System** built using **Python Flask** with a **MySQL database**.  
It’s a basic **CRUD** application (Create, Read, Update, Delete) that lets users manage inventory records.

This is my **first time hosting a project with a database**.  
I usually host front-end projects on **GitHub Pages**, but this time I wanted to try setting up a full-stack app using **PythonAnywhere**.

I learned how to:
- Connect Flask with a remote MySQL database  
- Configure database credentials  
- Deploy an app online instead of using localhost  
- Work with passwords, account setup, and hosting settings  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS  
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Hosting:** PythonAnywhere  

## 🧩 Features

- Add new inventory items  
- View all inventory records  
- Edit existing items  
- Delete items  
- Simple and easy-to-use interface  

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add user login and authentication  
- Improve UI and responsiveness  
- Add search and sorting features  
- Handle validation and error messages  

## 🙌 Acknowledgment

This project marks my **first experience deploying a web app with a database**.  
I’m using it to learn how hosting, configuration, and deployment work outside of local development.  
Next, I plan to explore more about database setup, environment variables, and production-level Flask apps.
